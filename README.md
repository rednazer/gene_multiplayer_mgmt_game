TODO:
Redo the printouts with stats (stats currently have no apparent meaning)
Add end turn with decrementing the farm counters. Check resistance vs season (also add season) and reduce yield from that
Add multiplayer framework - features to include with this are sharing farmland (and maybe # crafts)
Add popup visuals to replace Debug.Log comments to give player more information
Balance money
Give the game real visuals
