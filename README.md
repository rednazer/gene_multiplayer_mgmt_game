Gene Multiplayer Management Game
To play, push button on screen (placeholder for menu).
When in game, drag items from left side to the top 2 crafting boxes to show in the punnet square.
Look at different seed stats with the side buttons (this may change later in dev)
Craft buton crafts items into the bottom craft box
In the bottom right, you can change to farm view where you can plant seeds and buy farm plots (still in dev)
You can also end turn in bottom right corner (not completed yet)

TODO:
	Possibly remove resistance as a stat (only grow rate/quantity)
	Redo the printouts with stats (stats currently have no apparent meaning)
X	Add end turn with decrementing the farm counters. Check resistance vs season (also add season) and reduce yield from that
	Add multiplayer framework - features to include with this are sharing farmland (and maybe # crafts)
X	Add popup visuals to replace Debug.Log comments to give player more information
	Balance money
	Give the game real visuals
